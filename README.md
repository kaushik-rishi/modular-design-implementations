# Design Module Implementations

## Background
Design patterns are too theoretical and practising questions like "design a cab sharing system" are too standard. 
- extremely theoretical concepts are fun to learn, but it's really hard to form a deeper mental understanding of the concept before actually going ahead and using it in a small POC / real world application

## Contents
Anything specific to becoming a better overall engineer, It could be
- Implementation of an RFC
- Backend dev concept like feature flags
- Building a small SDK for an API
- May be, just may be, concurrency patterns and confusing asynchronous error handling examples
- Building bindings for a Java library in python
- etc, etc, etc

In all the above, wherever it is possible, highest emphasis will be given to code design
